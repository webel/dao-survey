# Thesis Survey

The live survey is [here](thesis.stenqvist.co/#survey).

The communities input is seen as the most indicative to which way the wind blows within the DAO space seeing as it moves fast and at the whim of the beating hearts of the community.

My dream would be for this document to be a living document - i.e. for it to change over time, and for that change to be captured here in commits so we can turn back time and see what questions we were asking 2022.

For now, my initial questions will live in [`survey.json`](./survey.json) in hope of receiving input.
